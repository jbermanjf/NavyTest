JDTA Type
A JOB is made up of duties and tasks. A job can be determined from either a top-down approach or a bottom-up approach where the tasks and duties are analyzed to determine what the job is. A listing of Enlisted Occupational Jobs is contained within Volume I of Navy Personnel (NAVPERS) 18068, which may provide some insight into job selection criteria.
For Aviation - Job
1. Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC).
2. Designator (Naval Officers).
3. Navy Rating and NEC Title (NEC I40A - Aircraft Instrument Intermediate Maintenance Activity Technician).

A DUTY is a major part of a job. It occupies a major part of the work time and occurs often in the work cycle. A cluster of duties constitutes a job. A duty involves a group of closely related tasks. 
For Aviation - Duty
1. Set of closely related tasks within a given job.
2. Requires a minimum of two tasks.
3. Must be performed frequently and occupy a significant amount of time.

A TASK is a major part of a duty. Clusters of tasks make up a duty. It is performed in a relatively short period of time and is observable and measurable. Each task is an independent part of the job; it is also independent of other tasks. Tasks are NOT components of a procedure.

For Aviation – Task
This skill level is the heart of the JDTA, requires in-depth, accurate information, and is directly linked with training content development.
1. Single unit of specific work behavior, with clear beginning and end points.
2. Directly observable and measurable.

A SUB-TASK is major part of a task. A sub-task may be made up of a series of steps performed under the standards and conditions of a task. A sub-task has a logical relationship with a task, duty, job, and occupation. A sub-task may be comprised of one or more steps and fills a portion of the immediate purpose within a task.

Criticality of Performance points to the need for selecting tasks for training that are essential to job performance, when required, even though the tasks may not be performed frequently. Criticality is a measure of how essential a task is to job performance. The consequences of inadequate performance on certain tasks could result in injury to personnel, loss of life, or damage to equipment. Inadequate performance could have a serious impact on the mission, the operation, the product, the equipment, or the operator. 

For example, the probable consequences of inadequate performance of such combat tasks as ""Identifying enemy aircraft"" could be loss of life and equipment. Another example, the probable criticality of performance of the task ""Write trip report"" is negligible. If this task were selected for training, it would be on the basis of factors other than probable criticality of performance. To obtain data on this criterion, individuals who are familiar with the job are asked to rate probable consequences of inadequate task performance according to the categories listed below:

Drop Down
1. Minor. The consequence of inadequate task performance results in no injury to personnel or damage to equipment.
2. Marginal. The consequence of inadequate task performance results in non-serious personnel injury or damage to equipment.
3. Critical. The consequence of inadequate task performance results in serious or life threatening injury to personnel, or impedes the ability to perform a mission.
4. Catastrophic. The consequence of inadequate task performance results in death or being unable to carry out a mission.

Task Delay Tolerance 
A measure of how much time can elapse between the time that the need for task performance becomes evident and the time that the actual performance must begin. There are some tasks encountered by job incumbents, as part of their normal job, in which no delay of task performance can be tolerated. The job incumbent must be capable of performing the task, without taking time to read how the task is done or finding someone to provide advice. For other tasks, a minor delay might be acceptable, or even mandatory, while the job incumbent gets advice, checks technical orders, regulations, etc. For some tasks, there may be time to assemble a group of experts to confer with before proceeding.
Urgency in completing a task.

Some examples of task delay tolerance are as follows:
a. Tasks determined to have a low delay tolerance should be given relatively high priority for selection for training. The following are examples of low delay tolerance tasks requiring immediate performance:
(1) Use artificial respiration to restore the breathing of an accident victim.
(2) Pull ripcord of emergency parachute if main parachute fails.
(3) Extinguish fire in aircraft engine during startup on flight line.

b. A high delay tolerance does not exclude a task from training, but indicates that other factors will be more of a basis for acceptance or rejection. To obtain data on this criterion, individuals who are familiar with the job are asked to rate the amount of delay that can be tolerated before performance begins. Examples of tasks having a higher delay tolerance, thereby permitting delay in performance, would include:
(1) Review books for unit library.
(2) Refill fire extinguisher after use.
(3) Write trip report.

99.9 % of maintenance Tasks SHOULD be “2 – High delay tolerance""

Drop Down
1. Low delay tolerance - Immediate priority, e.g.,  ""Fighting a fire, Extinguishing a Class D fire, Performing CPR""

Frequency of Performance
This is a measure of how often the task is performed.  While the probable consequences of inadequate performance of a particular task are serious and the task delay tolerance is low, the task may still rate low for training priority if it is rarely performed. Select the closest frequency based on an average. A practical way to collect frequency of performance data on tasks is to rate their frequency of performance on a scale such as the following:

Drop Down
1. At least annually.
2. At least once every 6 months.
3. At least monthly, but less than twice per month.
4. Twice per week or more.
","Select from Drop Down or Manually Copy and Paste from provided JDTA
Probability of Inadequate Performance Due to Training 
This is a measure of how often a task is performed in a non-acceptable manner. The criterion for probability of inadequate performance is used to ensure that training is given to those essential tasks that job incumbents frequently perform poorly. By recording the judgments of knowledgeable personnel regarding the probability of deficient performance, a list of these poorly performed tasks can be produced.  Training of these tasks, regardless of their criticality, must be given serious consideration. For example, if equipment downtime is often caused by faulty soldering, this skill may require additional emphasis in a list of tasks selected for training maintenance personnel. Another example, if widespread theft of items guarded by security personnel is a problem, the tasks of guard packages, materials, and property and ""prepare physical security plans"" may require additional emphasis. To obtain data on the probability of inadequate performance, supervisors of job incumbents may be asked to rate each task as to how often the task is performed in a nonacceptable manner according to the scale below:

Drop Down
1. Never performed correctly.
2. Less often than other tasks.
3. About as often as other tasks.

Difficulty of Performance of a task refers to the time, effort, and assistance required to achieve performance proficiency. How long it takes to learn to perform a task proficiently.  Select the average time it takes to learn the task. When measuring the difficulty of performance the following criteria is used:

Drop Down
1. No training required.

Task Learning Difficulty
Some tasks encountered in each job are so easy or so familiar that they can be readily learned on the job without formal training. At the other extreme, some tasks are so complicated that a job incumbent can perform them adequately only after lengthy, formal training. Other tasks lie somewhere in between these two extremes and require different levels of training.
a. Tasks easy enough to be learned on the job without training might be:
(1) Sweep floors.
(2) Collect food trays from patients in hospital wards.
(3) Distribute unclassified correspondence in an office.

b. Tasks that can require lengthy, formal training might be:
(1) Diagnose malfunction in an airborne radar weapons system.
(2) Defuse unexploded enemy bombs.
(3) Identify parasites in clinical specimens.

Task learning difficulty scale. To obtain data on the task learning difficulty, job incumbents or others may be asked to rate tasks they perform as to the training time required to achieve proficiency, or to the difficulty of learning the task on the job without formal training.  The following rating scale may be used:

Drop Down
1. No training required.
2. Task requires 1 to 3 days to learn.
3. Task may be learned in 1 to 2 weeks.
4. Task may require up to 1 month or more to learn.

Percent Performing
This criterion, the percentage of job incumbents who perform the task, points to the need for training tasks that are most often performed on the job. For example: One task for a weather technician might be ""Answer telephone inquiries about the weather."" If you found that 96 percent of all weather technicians performed this task, the implications for training would be different than if you found that only 10 percent performed it.  In the above example, if only 10 percent of job incumbents perform the task, there is a strong probability that training resources would be wasted if all weather technicians were trained to perform the task. Gathering this data is as simple as asking the question ""Do you perform this task?"" The following rating scale might be used:

Drop Down
a. 0 to 24% of the personnel perform this task.
b. 25 to 49% of the personnel perform this task.
c. 50 to 74% of the personnel perform this task.
d. 75 to 100% of the personnel perform this task.

Percentage of Time Spent on Performance within the Job
The percentage of time spent performing a task is a criterion that points to a need for providing training to assist job incumbents in efficient performance of those tasks on which they spend the most time. Selection of tasks for training based on this criterion offers chances for high payoff in terms of return on training dollars expended. To obtain data for determining the percentage of time spent performing the tasks in a job, inputs are required from a large number of job incumbents. Usually they are not asked to state the percentage of their time spent on each task because such a question would be very difficult to answer. Instead, they are usually asked to rate each task as to the amount of time spent performing it as compared to their other tasks. For example, ""Rate the relative amount of time spent performing each task."" Relative time spent means the total time spent performing the task compared with the time spent on each of the other tasks. The following rating scale might be used:

Drop Down
a. Task is not performed.
b. Less time spent on this task than most other tasks.
c. Same amount of time spent on this task as most others.
d. More time spent on this task than most others.
","Select from Drop Down or Manually Copy and Paste from provided JDTA
Immediacy of Performance
Immediacy of performance refers to the time interval between completion of training and performance of the task on the job and has some significance in selecting tasks for training. A factor for selecting tasks for training is whether or not there is a high probability of the graduate encountering the task on the job fairly soon after completing training. ""Fairly soon"" means, in this context, that tasks encountered within the first year after training would, everything else being equal, be weighed more heavily for selection than those not encountered until one to two years later. Consider also the predicted or measured amount of decay of the skill that will take place during the time interval. To obtain data on this criterion, job incumbents and others might be asked to rate the time between job entry and task performance on a scale such as the following:

Drop Down
a. Task first performed within 2 to 4 years after assignment.
b. Task first performed within 1 to 2 years after assignment.
c. Task first performed within 6 months after assignment.
d. Task performed during first 3 months after assignment.
